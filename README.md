The work of me and in looking back on previous case totals and attempting to see if there is a correlation between the number of cases and the air quality on the day that people may have been infected. Will be submitted to the NJRSF! Our work is sorted into various categories depicting the code that we used to create the backend of our system to decide whether air quality really did have an influence on case transmission. Eventually, I will paste the abstract that is submitted to NJRSF here for a more detailed summary.
